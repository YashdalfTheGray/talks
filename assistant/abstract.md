# Using Slack, Hubot and IoT to create a virtual house assistant

## Abstract

We've all wondered at one point or another about Tony Stark's Jarvis and what it would take to get Jarvis in our homes. Well, it is easier than you might think! This talk will help set up a framework to create your very own virtual assistant using Slack, a bot framework from Github called Hubot and the various internet connected smart devices that are becoming commonplace in homes. Hubot takes minutes to set up, a few more minutes to connect with Slack (there are other methods of communication supported as well) and most smart gadgets provide an API to talk to them. Furthermore, teaching new responses to Hubot is a very easy and well-documented process. These pieces come together to form the basis of our very own Jarvis, one we can start using almost immediately!
