## Opener

Show of hands, who wish they had something like Tony Stark's Jarvis? Who wouldn't want a personal assistant that can connect to things in your house and help you out whenever you need it. Matching Jarvis' intelligence and presence is still not fully out of the realm of science fiction, we can get pretty close. All it takes is some components, some duct tape here and some glue there.

Let's get into the details of making this thing work. We'll get started with making our house more intelligent. There are a lot of IoT devices that you can find for the low cost of $99 per thing (technical term) and spread across the house but instead of paying all that money, we can get the components and with a little work, get the same product for much less.

## Components involved

Starting from the other end - IoT, Hubot and then Slack

## IoT

Particle, Raspberry Pi, Arduino

## Hubot

Getting started, chat adapters, running locally, running on Heroku, Docker?

## Slack

Setting up a slack team, adding your bot, giving it a cool name, constructing help

## That's all folks
