## Opener

Show of hands, who wish they had something like Tony Stark's Jarvis? Who wouldn't want a personal assistant that can connect to things in your house and help you out whenever you need it. Matching Jarvis' intelligence and presence is still not fully out of the realm of science fiction, we can get pretty close. All it takes is some components, some duct tape here and some glue there.

Let's get into the details of making this thing work. We'll get started with making our house more intelligent. There are a lot of IoT devices that you can find for the low cost of $99 per thing (technical term) and spread across the house but instead of paying all that money, we can get the components and with a little work, get the same product for much less. Once we have devices that collect data from across the house, we'll use GitHub's Hubot to request that data and the finally, Slack to display that data in a nice way.

## Components involved

As mentioned above, we'll connect smart devices in our house to GitHub's Hubot project and then use slack to ask Hubot questions which will get us access to the data in a more conversational way than just a dashboard on the web or a readout display. Over the next few sections, we'll look at these pieces in detail and put it all together to ulitmately achieve conversational user experience like Jarvis.

## IoT

Particle, Raspberry Pi, Arduino

## Hubot

Getting started, chat adapters, running locally, running on Heroku, Docker?

## Slack

Setting up a slack team, adding your bot, giving it a cool name, constructing help

## Pull it all together

Any glue/duct tape that needs mentioning here

## That's all folks
