# Canaries and Acceptance Testing Using Docker

## Abstract

In this talk, we'll go over how to write canaries and integration tests using Puppeteer, an automation framework and Jest, a BDD testing framework. Then we'll add the special sauce to the mix - Docker. This helps us run tests on the developer's machine, as part of the code release workflow and also as a deep health check Canary for the service; in house or in the cloud!
