## Ideas

- Time and motion theory
- Everyone used to have to have a generator, now people can just plug into the power grid
- Set expectations
- what is a canary

## Outline

- [You should know][3]

- Intro - name, descriptors
- ‚òÅÔ∏è üëà I work there
- Agenda
  - [grandma finds the internet][0] - where the project came from

  - [to infinity and beyond][2] - where I want it to go
  - [the stack][4] - how it works
- How the project started
- Current state

## Detail

### Intro

- Name
- Descriptors - make `people` show up first

### Agenda

Show the pictures

### The struggle

_Grandma finds the internet_

### The solution

_Great job success_

### Where it can go

_to infinity and beyond_

### The tech stack

_the burger stack_

Powerfpuff girls - the tech stack is sugar, spice and everything nice.

That's the usual mix, Javascript, Puppeteer, Jest.

But our chemical X, is Docker. Docker elevates our stack to the next level. We can run our tests ANYWHERE.

## Meeting notes

Define canary, set expectation
