# Creating a smart HVAC system with Particle Photons

## Abstract

Have you ever wondered how an HVAC thermostat works? Simply put, a temperature sensor controls which switch gets flipped, heating or cooling. But what if that process was decentralized? Instead of the HVAC controller just taking one data point, could it take the whole house into consideration? This talk will explore ways to create an extensible system to replace a "dumb" HVAC control unit using Particle Photons and some temperature sensors and relays. A system like this can make more efficient decisions about heating and cooling and even create more even temperatures across the house. Let's leverage the data already present around us and maybe even save some money while doing it!
