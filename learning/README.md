# Managing Your Learning

## Abstract

It seems like there is a new JavaScript framework or a Go library released everyday. And have you heard about Elm? In a world where software technology is moving at a breakneck pace and rapid innovation is the name of the game, how do you keep up? In this talk, we'll discuss managing your learning and tracking it like an actual project. We'll look at how to solve some of the major problems like motivation, accountability and time management. I hope to deliver methods that anyone can use to learn new skills, develop their career and stay on top of new technology independent of schedules and/of life.
