## Opener

I try to learn something new every day and I've been working hard at it for more than a year and 9 months now. In that time, I've learned a lot about Javascript, Android, iOS, Ruby, Go, best practices and I've ran and committed to open source projects.

It all started when I read this article by David Leonard called [500 day commit streak](http://drksephy.github.io/2015/07/02/commit/). In it he talks about how he started a Github streak to get better as a developer and a problem solver. Taking inspiration from him, I started my own streak without any expectations. Self analyzing around the 500 day mark, I found that I not only knew more about a handful of languages, I could also break down a problem quicker and easier. I had also improved my ability to produce well-crafted, easy to understand code.

## Common Problems

So how did I do it? How do I continue to write or create something new every day? It's about forming a habit. Habits, though, are notoriously hard to form. It takes 66 days, on average, to form a habit, sometimes more. Over my time with the Github streak, I've realized that there are a few factors that impede this habit formation.

* Time
* Motivation
* Accountability
* Goals

There was a game on the PS3 called Shadow of the Colossus. There were no enemies in the game, just a bunch of bosses, the Colossi that you would have to defeat. Each one took planning, timing and action. This is how we have to approach learning.

## Time

Start small, Rome wasn't built in one day. That is really the name of the game here. People have families, kids, other engagements, video games, dates, friends, etc. These can't be ignored but it doesn't mean that there is no time at all. The idea here is to find a quick 5 minutes to look something up.

As an example, if you want to stand up a API server in Go, the task for tonight would be to take a look at what the HTTP capabilities of Go are without any libraries and take a couple of lines of notes for investigation tomorrow. This is easy enough that it can be done on your phone while waiting for lunch or while laying in bed at night.

If you find more time on your hands, write some sample code and solve a small problem that helps with the bigger project. Use things like REPLs to get started and iterate quickly. Another way could be using an app like Duolingo or Enki to run through quick sub 5-minute exercises that can help move you towards a bigger goal.

## Motivation

Repetition is the key.

You might be saying to yourself, well if I want to stand up an API server in Go (given that I don't know any Go), I'm going to have learn Go which means going back to basics. Learning how to print to the command line, import libraries and declare variables, done a few times, makes it easier to lose motivation.

"First I have to learn a whole language and then I can start this project, why bother..."

Instead, I suggest the learn as you go technique, start your project off by looking at some sample code and then search up unfamiliar syntax. This way, you learn the language while also driving towards your goal. This might actually help you learn the language better since you'll be able to recall specific syntax because you've seen it outside of just sample code.

But it's a balance - starting on too many projects right away in a flash of hyper-motivation is more likely to end in a loss of motivation as well. Many different projects means an increase in context switches which can obscure progress and also take up a lot of extra time that you may not have. Both of these can lead to frustration and then loss of motivation.

I'm going to use juggling as example because I think it works. If you're juggling a lot of things and you drop one, it's more likely to throw you off your rhythm. This is the same with having a lot of projects going at the same time, loss of motivation on one is more likely to lead to others also being deprioritized.

## Accountability

Another problem is accountability and it goes hand in hand with finding the time and the motivation. The harder it is to see that you're progressing in your learning, the harder it will seem to justify the time and find the motivation. We all subconsciously weigh the opportunity cost of every option and pick the one with the best return on investment. It's just human programming and accountability can help prioritize your learning in the planning meeting in your brain.

Sounds pretty good in theory...and also works in practice!

There are plenty of tools out there to help structure work but we only think of them in a work-related context. Tools like Trello and Github Projects are often used on teams to coordinate work but they are just as effective at helping organize and plan your learning.

Both of the tools I mentioned are free, making an account takes minutes and soon after, you can start adding cards to lists and breaking down your learning plan. Seeing it all laid out helps with three aspects. First, knowing how much time you can devote helps you size tasks appropriately, break up ones that might be too big or reserve them for when you might have more time. Second, it helps you create a step-by-step plan of how to effectively consume the knowledge. Third, it helps reveal dependencies amongst tasks.

For programming specifically, you can use tools like Wakatime to track your time working with a language or a certain project, week-over-week.

## Goals

Like I said in the introduction, the core idea is to make a habit and setting goals can potentially interfere with that.

There are two issues with setting goals - the process and the goal itself. When you set a goal for yourself, you create an ultimatum, whether on paper or in your mind, and you put into place a process for working towards that goal. Over time, the process will start to feel rigid and uninteresting. This can be due to lack of time (life happens), lack of visible progress or waning interest. The more it starts to feel like a burden to come back to your project day after day, the less you will learn from it.

The other issue is the goal itself. Once the goal is accomplished and your brain gets a large delivery of dopamine, there isn't a reason to be motivated any further. Lost motivation means that you will most likely not form a habit - back to square one.

My suggestion is to split that large dose of dopamine into smaller interest payments over time. All of us have a built in reward system in our bodies and it works very simply. We accomplish something, we see loved ones, we eat good food, we feel good. That feeling is an elevated level of dopamine in your brain.

This reward system can be tinkered with - telling yourself that you should look up the history of an old fashioned and doing it leads to a small dose of dopamine and a sense of accomplishment. You learned something new, you deserve some dopamine. Doing this day after day will start to wire your brain to look for that little dose of dopamine, to crave it almost. This will incentivize the learning and help push it past being a goal - making it a habit.

## Closer

There is a lot of information here and it's not meant to be instituted immediately. The methods here should be implemented as they are deemed necessary or as we ramp up on the road to creating a habit. Additionally, as we get close to the point where a habit is starting to form, these systems, the overhead, will start to become vestigial and break away. It will start to feel natural to learn something new every day and you'll find more time and motivation for learning.

At some point during this process, you might feel like maintaining your Github streak or moving a Trello card to the done column but over time, these things will become secondary to the excitement of learning something new. Personally, the last 600 days have pretty much been about the learning rather than a streak.

I'm happy to answer questions about my journey. I also want to point out that it might help some people to have an accountabillabuddy - someone who holds them accountable early on as the habit is forming. I'm more than happy to serve as that person!
