# Contributing to Open Source Software

## Abstract

From software foundations like Linux and Mozilla advocating for open exchange of information to places like GitHub or Gitlab hosting millions and millions of lines of code, Open Source Software (OSS) has become a mainstay in the industry. In this talk, we'll explore a little bit of the history of OSS, look a the roots and also take a look at where it is now. I'll talk about some ways to get involved in open source and the benefits I've seen personally and professionally.
