## What is OSS?

According to the dictionary, open source software is anything for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. Practically speaking, OSS is any software that you can go look at the inner workings of, allows you to go make copies and make changes and accepts contributions from sources other than the team of maintainers.

Even more practically, any software hosted publically on Github! ðŸ˜ƒ
