# Learn You React

## Abstract

This talk is a simple introduction to React, the syntax, JSX and how React works. We're going to start with an overview, talk about the basic syntax, add JSX to the mix and then move to talking about dataflow and state. There are resources at the end of the presentation to get started with your own journey through react.
