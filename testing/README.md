# Test all the Javascript

## Abstract

Javascript exists in so many places now and in so many forms - browser, Node.js, React, Angular and Typescript! And they all have their own, slightly different testing needs. On top of that, we as developers don't want to have to hop from testing framework to framework because a year of doing that and our brains have turned into mush. In this talk, we'll take some time to set up testing environments for a few different forms of Javascript individually and then explore where we can double-dip and maximize our return on investment.
