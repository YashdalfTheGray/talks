# Around Typescript in (less than) 60 minutes

## Abstract

Typescript initially started as a superset of ES2015 with added type annotations and has constantly evolved gaining more features and providing more and more help for early detection of bugs and issues. The type system continues to evolve to meet new usecases and the helpful errors from the language server lead to immediate time savings when working on a feature. This is what Javascript at scale looks like. In this talk, we'll take a whirlwind tour of Typescript, going over everything from using the built in types, adding your own types, typings files and a couple of other features that typescript provides.
